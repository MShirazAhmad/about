Introduction
============

As no any optical instrument support infinite band-width of frequencies
of beam[^1]. Science is almost reached on its upper limit of scientific
revolution. With daily base increase of Internet, mobile phone users,
needs are also being increasing. Many new methods have been developed
like multi core fiber (to fulfill needs) in which every core supports
some band-width. This problem of limited bandwidths can be resolved by
shifting our communication system on Orbital Angular Momentum (*OAM*) of
light beams. As light beam can carry infinite *OAM* states[^2]
theoretically, if we denote signal with $\ell$ we can increase band
width of signals to $\ell=\infty$ theoretically, hence if we will be
able to do that task, problems that are caused due to limitation on
bandwidth will be resolved.\
In this paper, we have provided brief review on basics, some famous ways
to generate and detect *OAM*, limitations and future scope.

Optical angular momentum
========================

Light beam carries angular momentum (AM). Total angular momentum is
superposition of Spin and Orbital AM [@Allen1992]. Orbital angular
momentum (*OAM*) can be further divided into two categories,i. e
external *OAM* and internal *OAM*. External *OAM* is origin dependent
which means at any point, if we want to measure *OAM*, simply we take
cross product of center of beam with its total linear angular
momentum[^3]. Our main interest in this paper has remained in internal
*OAM* as it is origin independent [@Padgett2004].\
As beam of light contains sinusoidally varying Electric and Magnetic
field components. Net energy transfered is represented by poynting
vector
$\overrightarrow{\textbf{P}}=\frac{1}{\mu_0}\overrightarrow{\textbf{E}}x\overrightarrow{\textbf{B}}$
where $\mu_0$ is vacuum permittivity,$\textbf{E}$ and $\textbf{B}$ are
electric and magnetic field vectors[^4].

In case of plane wave fronts, $\overrightarrow{\textbf{P}}$ remains
parallel to beam axes, but beam can also be generated in such a way that
$\overrightarrow{\textbf{P}}$ no longer remains parallel to beam axis,
but circulates around beam axis, making helical shape, such beam is also
called optical vortex. These beams with optical vortex are shown in
**Fig. 3** ([\[l0\]](#l0){reference-type="ref"
reference="l0"}-[\[l3b\]](#l3b){reference-type="ref"
reference="l3b"})[^5] Such beams with azimuthal dependence of phase
fronts actually contain Orbital Angular Momentum[@OSA]. Azimuthal
dependence can be defined by $\exp{(-i\ell\phi)}$, where $\ell$ is
integer (which characterize *Helical Modes* that can have any value
(positive or negative)) whos positive values belong to right circulation
and negative values belongs to left circulation.

$\ell=0$ characterizes normal EM beam whose phase fronts or wave fronts
are plane surfaces,this can be seen in **Fig.**
[\[l0\]](#l0){reference-type="ref" reference="l0"}, where as intensity
profile of such beam can be seen in **Fig.**
[\[PhaseFront\_l0\]](#PhaseFront_l0){reference-type="ref"
reference="PhaseFront_l0"}. In same way, $\ell=\pm1$ characterizes
single helical surface with $\text{Step Length}=\lambda$ (Helical
pattern can be seen in **Fig.** [\[l1a\]](#l1a){reference-type="ref"
reference="l1a"} with intensity profile **Fig.**
[\[PhaseFront\_l1\]](#PhaseFront_l1){reference-type="ref"
reference="PhaseFront_l1"} which belongs to $\ell=+1$ and **Fig.**
[\[l1b\]](#l1b){reference-type="ref" reference="l1b"} belongs to
$\ell=-1$). Theoretically, We can make as much modes we want by setting
values of $\ell$ with $\text{Step Length}=|\ell|\lambda$,here $\ell$ is
called topological charge of optical vortex, $\phi$ is azimuthal
coordinate of beam cross section. *OAM* modes with different values of
topological charge and their intensity profiles are shown in **Fig.** 3
and **Fig.** 4 respectively. [^6]

Production of OAM states
========================

*OAM* modes with $\ell=\pm1$ exist in nature, higher modes do not exist
naturally but can be generated using artificial ways.Some popular ways
to generate these modes includes using Spiral Phase Plates, Diffraction
Grating, Spacial Light Modulators etc.

Spiral Phase Plates
-------------------

These can be of plastic or some transparent medium whose thickness
increases azimuthally. Plane phase front after passes through it,
changes into twisted ones (As shown in **Fig.**
[\[fig:drawing\]](#fig:drawing){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:drawing"}). Thickness of such *Spiral Phase
Plates*[@Starikov] are designed according to formula
$T=(\ell\lambda)/(n-1)$, where $T$ is change in thickness between
thinnest and thickest part of plate, during moving around 360 degree in
azimuthal angle. Some difficulties can be caused, if we try to generate
*OAM* using *Spiral Phase Plates* as these plates only support
wavelength for which they are designed for. Moreover they are expensive
and are not adjustable.

width="0.7\linewidth"}

Diffraction Grating
-------------------

parallel lines of diffraction grating produce $\ell=0$ lines, and if we
design diffraction grating with middle part fork like (Ref. **Fig.**
[\[SLMl1\]](#SLMl1){reference-type="ref" reference="SLMl1"}), then
different modes can be generated, where as $\ell$ of *OAM* increases as
number of lines on fork dislocation increases.

Spatial Light Modulator(SLM)
----------------------------

It is a device which is used to modulate phase and intensity of beam,
hence *OAM* modes can be generated. A program designed in Matlab[@SLM]
can be used to generate holograms (for specific topological charge) in
\*.bmp format and can be loaded in SLM[@King], high quality beams can
easily be generated[@Matsumoto2008]. **Fig.**
[\[SLMl0\]](#SLMl0){reference-type="ref" reference="SLMl0"} belongs to
$\ell=0$, hence effects no change on plane wave front, **Fig.**
[\[SLMl1\]](#SLMl1){reference-type="ref" reference="SLMl1"} belongs to
$\ell=1$ and converts **Fig.** [\[l0\]](#l0){reference-type="ref"
reference="l0"} to **Fig.** [\[l1a\]](#l1a){reference-type="ref"
reference="l1a"},In the same way **Fig.**
[\[SLMl2\]](#SLMl2){reference-type="ref" reference="SLMl2"} belongs to
$\ell=2$ and converts **Fig.** [\[l0\]](#l0){reference-type="ref"
reference="l0"} to **Fig.** [\[l2a\]](#l2a){reference-type="ref"
reference="l2a"} and **Fig.** [\[SLMl3\]](#SLMl3){reference-type="ref"
reference="SLMl3"} belongs to $\ell=3$ and converts **Fig.**
[\[l0\]](#l0){reference-type="ref" reference="l0"} to **Fig.**
[\[l3a\]](#l3a){reference-type="ref" reference="l3a"}. Another thing to
note here is that if we pass again these beams with newly generated
*OAM* with same holograms, we recover back old phase fronts.

Diffractive holographic filters
-------------------------------

Computer generated holographic filters is modern technique to generate
and isolate *OAM* components.Holographic pictures printed on transparent
paper with high resolution also can do required work, hence we can print
shapes of **Fig. 2** to generate *OAM*. Further details can be seen in
Ref. [@Starikov].

Although **Fig.**
[\[PhaseFront\_l0\]](#PhaseFront_l0){reference-type="ref"
reference="PhaseFront_l0"}-[\[PhaseFront\_l3\]](#PhaseFront_l3){reference-type="ref"
reference="PhaseFront_l3"} are phase fronts of different OAM modes, but
holograms of that shape can also generate OAM.

Detection of OAM states
=======================

As Spin of light beam can easily be measured[^7] by converting it into s
and p components and then measuring, but *OAM* can not be measured in
that way. Some techniques have been discovered to do that task. Most
easiest way to measure *OAM* value is by using Maczander Interferometry.

![**Fig.5** Interference pattern of Maczander Interferometry, when beam
carrying *OAM* is interfered with wave having plane
wave-front.](eps/MacZ0){width="\textwidth"}

\hfill

\hfill
![**Fig.5** Interference pattern of Maczander Interferometry, when beam

Beam containing *OAM* is interfered with beam having plane phase front
($\ell=0$) and then interference pattern is observed on screen. This
interference shows spiral patterns (As shown in **Fig. 5**) which starts
from center and slowly goes away with circulating. Number of lines
starting from center determines value of *OAM* $\ell$. In case of
absence of *OAM* (or $\ell=0$), dark spot appears as shown in **Fig.**
[\[MacZ0\]](#MacZ0){reference-type="ref" reference="MacZ0"}, If we
interfere beam of values $\ell=1,2,3$ with plane waves, we get
interference patterns like **Fig.**
[\[MacZ1\]](#MacZ1){reference-type="ref"
reference="MacZ1"},[\[MacZ2\]](#MacZ2){reference-type="ref"
reference="MacZ2"},[\[MacZ3\]](#MacZ3){reference-type="ref"
reference="MacZ3"}. we are not going in detail separating all modes from
single beam, but It can be seen in **Ref.**[@Jin2016]

Optical Communication system based on OAM
=========================================

It is possible to use *OAM* in our optical communication system to
replace conventional system in which different signals are being
transferred in different frequency modes. It is experimentally tested to
generate multi *OAM* modes, multiplex and transfer through conventional
multi-mode fiber successfully over 2. 6-km without loss of any
information. [@Zhu2017].\
In paper [@Trichili2016] it is tested to send up to 100 modes using
single hologram. Since this stream is under development we can hope that
soon *OAM* based communication system will be possible to replace total
communication system of world but currently it is under development.

Generation and detection of $\ell=+1$
=====================================

In summarizing, If we start with *OAM* $\ell=+1$ value, it will be easy
to understand above all. Let we want to generate beam carrying *OAM*
$\ell$ value 1, starting with LASER which produces $HG_{()0,0}$[^8].
Now, we can produce $\ell=+1$ mode either by passing it through
**Spacial Phase Plate** or hologram that look like **Fig.**
[\[SLMl1\]](#SLMl1){reference-type="ref" reference="SLMl1"}. We can also
generate this mode by **Spatial Light Modulator**, by generating \*. bmp
image for $\ell=+1$ from code mentioned in **Ref.** [@SLM] and loading
it into SLM. Phase front of that beam will look like **Fig.**
[\[l1a\]](#l1a){reference-type="ref" reference="l1a"} and Its
intersection will look like **Fig.**
[\[PhaseFront\_l1\]](#PhaseFront_l1){reference-type="ref"
reference="PhaseFront_l1"}. Now, we want to measure value of $\ell$, we
will have to interfere it with beam of plane phase front (Which look
like **Fig.** [\[l0\]](#l0){reference-type="ref" reference="l0"}) using
Maczander Interferometry arrangement, and we will obtain interference
pattern like **Fig.** [\[MacZ0\]](#MacZ0){reference-type="ref"
reference="MacZ0"}.

[^1]: Commonly different instruments support different limited band
    width

[^2]: *OAM* is independent of frequency, single frequency can also have
    infinite modes theoretically

[^3]: Quantum Mechanical picture can be seen [@Enk1994]

[^4]: Either light beam is linearly polarized or circularly polarized
    **P**, independent of polarization[\[FN1\]]{#FN1 label="FN1"}

[^5]: Do not confuse yourself with shape of circularly polarized light
    and *OAM*, since both looks same. In circularly polarized light,
    Electric and Magnetic field vectors rotate around propagation
    vector, where as in *OAM* with nonzero $\ell$, Poynting vector
    circulates around beam propagation.

[^6]: In this paper, plots up-to $\ell=\pm3$ are mentioned along their
    intensity profiles of phase fronts, further modes can alse be easily
    drawn by careful analysis of $\text{Step Length}=|\ell|\lambda$ and
    using Mathematica Codes mentioned in APPENDIX.

[^7]: Circularly polarized light contains spin. Spin can have only two
    possible values, hence right and left circularly polarized light
    contains these two values

[^8]: Normal Laser sources that can be found in optics Lab's generate
    these modes having $\ell=0$ (Plane phase fronts)
